# PC Teleprompter using C# and Windows Forms (.NET Framework)

**Project description:**<br>
This project allows you to be able to speak confidently during a recording. Just position the text window next to your recording device (WebCam, SmartPhone, etc), adjust the font size, colors, and movement speed according to your personal taste.
A teleprompter is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script. 
Because the speaker can look straight at the lens while reading the script, the teleprompter creates the illusion that the speaker has memorized the speech or is speaking spontaneously, looking directly into the camera lens. Notes or cue cards, on the other hand, require the presenter to look at them instead of at the lens, which leaves an impression of distraction.
